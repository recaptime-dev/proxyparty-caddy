# `proxyparty.recaptime.dev` = Docker + Caddy redirects and proxies

It's like [`proxyparty.hackclub.com`](https://github.com/hackclub/proxyparty) but using Caddy as our implementation backend, alongside a Hono server in Deno Deploy in cases where we cannot
add your domain into the Railway service backing this server.

Currently this service is provided on limited support basis and things may
break. [Consider sponsoring Andrei Jiroh](https://github.com/sponsors/ajhalili2006) or share your spare compute credits (or donate directly) on
[his Railway profile](https://railway.app/u/ajhalili2006) if you like to
keep this maintained and support his open-source work.
