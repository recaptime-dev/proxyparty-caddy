# `proxyparty.recaptime.dev` = Caddy in Docker + GCP Compute Engine VM

It's like [`proxyparty.hackclub.com`](https://github.com/hackclub/proxyparty)
but using Caddy as our implementation backend, hosted on a `e2-micro` Compute
Engine VM and on Railway as a Docker container.

Currently this service is provided on limited support basis and things may
break. [Consider sponsoring Andrei Jiroh](https://github.com/sponsors/ajhalili2006)
or share your spare compute credits (or donate directly) on
[his Railway profile](https://railway.app/u/ajhalili2006) if you like to
keep this maintained and support his open-source work.
